        <b>also</b> is a mission is to empower people by fostering genuine
        connections and promoting freedom of choice. In a world filled with
        siloed platforms, we aim to break down barriers by providing a
        user-friendly social search engine that respects consent and celebrates
        diversity.

      <p>
        Philosophically, we believe that individuals should have the liberty to
        navigate the online world on their terms. We aspire to contribute to a
        more unified internet where people are free to express their true
        selves. Higher-order communities, such as this, are one means of
        advancing this goal.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have a strong commitment to privacy and transparency. We prioritize
        safeguarding user data and ensure that our project adheres to ethical
        principles. Instead of competing with other platforms, we aim to
        collaborate and complement their services while placing users&apos;
        needs first.
      </p>

        Lastly, please note that we are not affiliated with any of the
        platforms/networks that we index. All of their stuff belongs to them.
